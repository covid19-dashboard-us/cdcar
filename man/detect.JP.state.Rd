\usage{
detect.JP.state(dat = list(), window = 14)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{A data frame or list containing the time series of infection or death cases.
\cr}

\item{level}{Level of data for detection. Level "county" represents county level data, and level "state" means state level data. Default is set to "county".
\cr}

\item{state.show}{Within the dataset, which state the detection algorithm should focus on.
\cr}

\item{county.show}{For county level data, which county the detection algorithm should focus on.
\cr}

\item{plot.show}{Whether show the time series plot during the detection procedure. Default is set to \code{NULL}.
\cr}

\item{cp.sd}{Default is set to 2.
\cr}

\item{slope.r}{Default is set to 5.
\cr}

\item{manual.decision}{Whether using the interactive decision mode. Default is set to \code{FALSE}.

}
\value{
A list containing the following information.
\cr
\code{dat.sub} The data which contains the information on the state/county specified.
\cr
\code{dat.new} The data after the order-dependency violation detection. \code{NA} represents the data point that needs repairment.
\cr
\code{n.OD} Number of order-dependency violation.
\cr
\code{dates.CP} The dates in the time series that the change-point occurred.
\cr
}
\description{
This function detects the order-dependency violation of county/state level covid-19 data (or similar type of data including the count time series and epidemic data).
